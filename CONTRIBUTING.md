# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this playbook!

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue** if you spot an error, have a suggestion, or want to discuss a new section
2. **Submit a PR** with your proposed changes — fixes, new attack scenarios, provider-specific tips, and updated code examples are all welcome
3. **Share your experience** — if you've encountered a security issue while building with AI tools that isn't covered here, we'd love to hear about it

## Guidelines

- Keep the tone practical and actionable — theory is fine, but always include "what to do"
- Every new checklist item should include a "Why it's dangerous" explanation in plain language
- Code examples should be generic (no project-specific details) and runnable
- If adding provider-specific guidance, cover at least 2 providers for comparison

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. We're all here to build more secure software.
